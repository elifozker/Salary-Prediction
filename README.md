The main purpose of our project is to make salary predictions by using descriptive
features in our dataset and different machine learning models and to make error rate
calculations and observe how accurate these predictions are. Data was collected from people
from different regions around the world in order to observe how values such as people's
education status and age caused changes in their salaries.

Title, Years of Experience, Salary, Country, Race and Senior. This dataset is compiled from
employment platforms and some surveys. It is useful to obtain information about labor
market trends in different professions. It is a dataset that can be used and analyzed to obtain
information about salaries and make informed decisions for business strategies. Salaries are

position, not 1.
